# Superstore-Sales-Dashboard
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard using Global Superstore 
dataset to visualize key business metrics such as total sales, quantity sold, average delivery time, and return 
orders. Implemented charts and maps to analyze sales performance by region, market, and segment. Integrated slicers
 for year-wise filtering and created insights like top 10 profit/loss products and top customers.
